Data Profiling Report

1. There are no null values so their handling can be skipped. Imputation would have be required in case of missing values
2. Fields Location, Locdesc and fiscal year has only one value. So, they can be used as meta data rather than in analysis.
3. Fiscal Season and SeasonDesc represents same data in different format. So one of them can be deleted
4. Class desc has less unique values than Class. So, we can conclude that multiple classes have same descriptions.
   If case was opposite we could argue same class has multiple description which could also be due to typo
5. Class field is drop only ClassDesc is used since it has more unique values and data won't be lost
6. Fiscal week and Day are date type data values and loading them as date will help on doing time related analysis
7. Data can be treated as time-series data representing daily transactions. So, loading day or Fiscal week as index helps in time series analysis
